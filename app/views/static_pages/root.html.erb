<div class="desription">
  <div>A text can come in any form and be any kind of writing. Letters, adverts, user-guides, emails,
postcards, notes and magazine articles are all different types of text.
When reading something, it helps to know what type of text it is. It also helps to know why it has
been written. For example: </div>
<ul>
  <li>An article written in the paper debating the ethics of someone's actions is <strong>argumentative</strong></li>
  <li>A user-guide is <strong>instructive</strong> and is written to tell you how to use something (such as a
  video recorder or washing-machine).</li>
  <li>A formal (business) letter might be written to <strong>inform</strong> you about school dates.</li>
  <li>A personal letter might be written by a friend, <strong>describing</strong> a holiday.</li>
</ul>

<div>Text can therefore be categorized into four broad categories: <i>Descriptive, Expository, Narrative</i> and <i>Argumentative</i></div>

<div>The purpose of this exercise is to use <strong>Machine Learning</strong> to identify what category a particular body of text is falls under*</div>

<div id="root">
  <form id='text-analyzer'>
    <textarea id="text" rows="8" cols="80" placeholder="Enter paragraph here"></textarea>
    <button type="submit" id="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</div>

<div class="random-text">
  <button id='random'>Random Text</button>
</div>

<div id="results">
  Results here!
</div>

<div class='caveat'>*Caveat: At the current moment, our machine learning algorithm can only identify texts of Narrative and Expository types, however functionality to add more types will be added soon</div>
